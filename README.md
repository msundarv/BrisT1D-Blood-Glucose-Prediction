# BrisT1D Blood Glucose Prediction

Type 1 diabetes is a chronic condition in which the body no longer produces the hormone insulin and therefore cannot regulate the amount of glucose (sugar) in the bloodstream. Without careful management, this can be life-threatening and so those with the condition need to inject insulin to manage their blood glucose levels themselves. There are many different factors that impact blood glucose levels, including eating, physical activity, stress, illness, sleep, alcohol, and many more, so calculating how much insulin to give is complex. The continuous need to think about how an action may impact blood glucose levels and what to do to counteract it is a significant burden for those with type 1 diabetes.

An important part of type 1 diabetes management is working out how blood glucose levels are going to change in the future. This work is a contribution to a Kaggle competition [1] regarding the same.

## Dataset

Please follow this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/brist1d/data) for the raw data.

Use `02_Data_Prep.ipynb` for building the dataset required for modeling notebooks.

## Prerequisites

Requires Python 3.12.

List of libraries required is [here](https://github.com/msundarv/BrisT1D-Blood-Glucose-Prediction/blob/main/requirements.txt)). 

## Next Steps

- More techniques [2] can used explored to fill in the missing data.
- By modifying the given problem statement [1][3], we can get more data for training.
- Sequential modeling [2] is yet to be explored.
